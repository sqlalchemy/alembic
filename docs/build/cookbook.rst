A collection of "How-Tos" highlighting popular ways to extend
Alembic.

.. note::

    This is a new section where we catalogue various "how-tos"
    based on user requests.  It is often the case that users
    will request a feature only to learn it can be provided with
    a simple customization.

.. _building_uptodate:

Building an Up to Date Database from Scratch
=============================================

There's a theory of database migrations that says that the revisions in existence for a database should be
able to go from an entirely blank schema to the finished product, and back again.   Alembic can roll
this way.   Though we think it's kind of overkill, considering that SQLAlchemy itself can emit
the full CREATE statements for any given model using :meth:`~sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData.create_all`.   If you check out
a copy of an application, running this will give you the entire database in one shot, without the need
to run through all those migration files, which are instead tailored towards applying incremental
changes to an existing database.

Alembic can integrate with a :meth:`~sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData.create_all` script quite easily.  After running the
create operation, tell Alembic to create a new version table, and to stamp it with the most recent
revision (i.e. ``head``)::

    # inside of a "create the database" script, first create
    # tables:
    my_metadata.create_all(engine)

    # then, load the Alembic configuration and generate the
    # version table, "stamping" it with the most recent rev:
    from alembic.config import Config
    from alembic import command
    alembic_cfg = Config("/path/to/yourapp/alembic.ini")
    command.stamp(alembic_cfg, "head")

When this approach is used, the application can generate the database using normal SQLAlchemy
techniques instead of iterating through hundreds of migration scripts.   Now, the purpose of the
migration scripts is relegated just to movement between versions on out-of-date databases, not
*new* databases.    You can now remove old migration files that are no longer represented
on any existing environments.

To prune old migration files, simply delete the files.   Then, in the earliest, still-remaining
migration file, set ``down_revision`` to ``None``::

    # replace this:
    #down_revision = '290696571ad2'

    # with this:
    down_revision = None

That file now becomes the "base" of the migration series.

Conditional Migration Elements
==============================

This example features the basic idea of a common need, that of affecting
how a migration runs based on command line switches.

The technique to use here is simple; within a migration script, inspect
the :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_x_argument` collection for any additional,
user-defined parameters.  Then take action based on the presence of those
arguments.

To make it such that the logic to inspect these flags is easy to use and
modify, we modify our ``script.py.mako`` template to make this feature
available in all new revision files:

.. code-block:: mako

    """${message}

    Revision ID: ${up_revision}
    Revises: ${down_revision}
    Create Date: ${create_date}

    """

    # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
    revision = ${repr(up_revision)}
    down_revision = ${repr(down_revision)}

    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa
    ${imports if imports else ""}

    from alembic import context


    def upgrade():
        schema_upgrades()
        if context.get_x_argument(as_dictionary=True).get('data', None):
            data_upgrades()

    def downgrade():
        if context.get_x_argument(as_dictionary=True).get('data', None):
            data_downgrades()
        schema_downgrades()

    def schema_upgrades():
        """schema upgrade migrations go here."""
        ${upgrades if upgrades else "pass"}

    def schema_downgrades():
        """schema downgrade migrations go here."""
        ${downgrades if downgrades else "pass"}

    def data_upgrades():
        """Add any optional data upgrade migrations here!"""
        pass

    def data_downgrades():
        """Add any optional data downgrade migrations here!"""
        pass

Now, when we create a new migration file, the ``data_upgrades()`` and ``data_downgrades()``
placeholders will be available, where we can add optional data migrations::

    """rev one

    Revision ID: 3ba2b522d10d
    Revises: None
    Create Date: 2014-03-04 18:05:36.992867

    """

    # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
    revision = '3ba2b522d10d'
    down_revision = None

    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa
    from sqlalchemy import String, Column
    from sqlalchemy.sql import table, column

    from alembic import context

    def upgrade():
        schema_upgrades()
        if context.get_x_argument(as_dictionary=True).get('data', None):
            data_upgrades()

    def downgrade():
        if context.get_x_argument(as_dictionary=True).get('data', None):
            data_downgrades()
        schema_downgrades()

    def schema_upgrades():
        """schema upgrade migrations go here."""
        op.create_table("my_table", Column('data', String))

    def schema_downgrades():
        """schema downgrade migrations go here."""
        op.drop_table("my_table")

    def data_upgrades():
        """Add any optional data upgrade migrations here!"""

        my_table = table('my_table',
            column('data', String),
        )

        op.bulk_insert(my_table,
            [
                {'data': 'data 1'},
                {'data': 'data 2'},
                {'data': 'data 3'},
            ]
        )

    def data_downgrades():
        """Add any optional data downgrade migrations here!"""

        op.execute("delete from my_table")

To invoke our migrations with data included, we use the ``-x`` flag::

    alembic -x data=true upgrade head

The :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_x_argument` is an easy way to support
new commandline options within environment and migration scripts.

.. _connection_sharing:

Sharing a Connection with a Series of Migration Commands and Environments
=========================================================================

It is often the case that an application will need to call upon a series
of commands within :ref:`alembic.command.toplevel`, where it would be advantageous
for all operations to proceed along a single transaction.   The connectivity
for a migration is typically solely determined within the ``env.py`` script
of a migration environment, which is called within the scope of a command.

The steps to take here are:

1. Produce the :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection` object to use.

2. Place it somewhere that ``env.py`` will be able to access it.  This
   can be either a. a module-level global somewhere, or b.
   an attribute which we place into the :attr:`.Config.attributes`
   dictionary (if we are on an older Alembic version, we may also attach
   an attribute directly to the :class:`.Config` object).

3. The ``env.py`` script is modified such that it looks for this
   :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection` and makes use of it, in lieu
   of building up its own :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` instance.

We illustrate using :attr:`.Config.attributes`::

    from alembic import command, config

    cfg = config.Config("/path/to/yourapp/alembic.ini")
    with engine.begin() as connection:
        cfg.attributes['connection'] = connection
        command.upgrade(cfg, "head")

Then in ``env.py``::

    def run_migrations_online():
        connectable = config.attributes.get('connection', None)

        if connectable is None:
            # only create Engine if we don't have a Connection
            # from the outside
            connectable = engine_from_config(
                config.get_section(config.config_ini_section),
                prefix='sqlalchemy.',
                poolclass=pool.NullPool)

        # when connectable is already a Connection object, calling
        # connect() gives us a *branched connection*.

        with connectable.connect() as connection:
            context.configure(
                connection=connection,
                target_metadata=target_metadata
            )

            with context.begin_transaction():
                context.run_migrations()

.. topic:: Branched Connections

    Note that we are calling the ``connect()`` method, **even if we are
    using a** :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection` **object to start with**.
    The effect this has when calling :meth:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.connect`
    is that SQLAlchemy passes us a **branch** of the original connection; it
    is in every way the same as the :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection`
    we started with, except it provides **nested scope**; the
    context we have here as well as the
    :meth:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.close` method of this branched
    connection doesn't actually close the outer connection, which stays
    active for continued use.

.. versionadded:: 0.7.5 Added :attr:`.Config.attributes`.

.. _replaceable_objects:

Replaceable Objects
===================

This recipe proposes a hypothetical way of dealing with
what we might call a *replaceable* schema object.  A replaceable object
is a schema object that needs to be created and dropped all at once.
Examples of such objects include views, stored procedures, and triggers.

Replaceable objects present a problem in that in order to make incremental
changes to them, we have to refer to the whole definition at once.
If we need to add a new column to a view, for example, we have to drop
it entirely and recreate it fresh with the extra column added, referring to
the whole structure; but to make it even tougher, if we wish to support
downgrade operarations in our migration scripts,
we need to refer to the *previous* version of that
construct fully, and we'd much rather not have to type out the whole
definition in multiple places.

This recipe proposes that we may refer to the older version of a
replaceable construct by directly naming the migration version in
which it was created, and having a migration refer to that previous
file as migrations run.   We will also demonstrate how to integrate this
logic within the :ref:`operation_plugins` feature introduced in
Alembic 0.8.  It may be very helpful to review
this section first to get an overview of this API.

The Replaceable Object Structure
--------------------------------

We first need to devise a simple format that represents the "CREATE XYZ" /
"DROP XYZ" aspect of what it is we're building.  We will work with an object
that represents a textual definition; while a SQL view is an object that we can define
using a `table-metadata-like system <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/wiki/UsageRecipes/Views>`_,
this is not so much the case for things like stored procedures, where
we pretty much need to have a full string definition written down somewhere.
We'll use a simple value object called ``ReplaceableObject`` that can
represent any named set of SQL text to send to a "CREATE" statement of
some kind::

    class ReplaceableObject(object):
        def __init__(self, name, sqltext):
            self.name = name
            self.sqltext = sqltext

Using this object in a migration script, assuming a Postgresql-style
syntax, looks like::

    customer_view = ReplaceableObject(
        "customer_view",
        "SELECT name, order_count FROM customer WHERE order_count > 0"
    )

    add_customer_sp = ReplaceableObject(
        "add_customer_sp(name varchar, order_count integer)",
        """
        RETURNS integer AS $$
        BEGIN
            insert into customer (name, order_count)
            VALUES (in_name, in_order_count);
        END;
        $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
        """
    )

The ``ReplaceableObject`` class is only one very simplistic way to do this.
The structure of how we represent our schema objects
is not too important for the purposes of this example; we can just
as well put strings inside of tuples or dictionaries, as well as
that we could define any kind of series of fields and class structures we want.
The only important part is that below we will illustrate how organize the
code that can consume the structure we create here.

Create Operations for the Target Objects
----------------------------------------

We'll use the :class:`.Operations` extension API to make new operations
for create, drop, and replace of views and stored procedures.  Using this
API is also optional; we can just as well make any kind of Python
function that we would invoke from our migration scripts.
However, using this API gives us operations
built directly into the Alembic ``op.*`` namespace very nicely.

The most intricate class is below.  This is the base of our "replaceable"
operation, which includes not just a base operation for emitting
CREATE and DROP instructions on a ``ReplaceableObject``, it also assumes
a certain model of "reversibility" which makes use of references to
other migration files in order to refer to the "previous" version
of an object::

    from alembic.operations import Operations, MigrateOperation

    class ReversibleOp(MigrateOperation):
        def __init__(self, target):
            self.target = target

        @classmethod
        def invoke_for_target(cls, operations, target):
            op = cls(target)
            return operations.invoke(op)

        def reverse(self):
            raise NotImplementedError()

        @classmethod
        def _get_object_from_version(cls, operations, ident):
            version, objname = ident.split(".")

            module = operations.get_context().script.get_revision(version).module
            obj = getattr(module, objname)
            return obj

        @classmethod
        def replace(cls, operations, target, replaces=None, replace_with=None):

            if replaces:
                old_obj = cls._get_object_from_version(operations, replaces)
                drop_old = cls(old_obj).reverse()
                create_new = cls(target)
            elif replace_with:
                old_obj = cls._get_object_from_version(operations, replace_with)
                drop_old = cls(target).reverse()
                create_new = cls(old_obj)
            else:
                raise TypeError("replaces or replace_with is required")

            operations.invoke(drop_old)
            operations.invoke(create_new)

The workings of this class should become clear as we walk through the
example.   To create usable operations from this base, we will build
a series of stub classes and use :meth:`.Operations.register_operation`
to make them part of the ``op.*`` namespace::

    @Operations.register_operation("create_view", "invoke_for_target")
    @Operations.register_operation("replace_view", "replace")
    class CreateViewOp(ReversibleOp):
        def reverse(self):
            return DropViewOp(self.target)


    @Operations.register_operation("drop_view", "invoke_for_target")
    class DropViewOp(ReversibleOp):
        def reverse(self):
            return CreateViewOp(self.view)


    @Operations.register_operation("create_sp", "invoke_for_target")
    @Operations.register_operation("replace_sp", "replace")
    class CreateSPOp(ReversibleOp):
        def reverse(self):
            return DropSPOp(self.target)


    @Operations.register_operation("drop_sp", "invoke_for_target")
    class DropSPOp(ReversibleOp):
        def reverse(self):
            return CreateSPOp(self.target)

To actually run the SQL like "CREATE VIEW" and "DROP SEQUENCE", we'll provide
implementations using :meth:`.Operations.implementation_for`
that run straight into :meth:`.Operations.execute`::

    @Operations.implementation_for(CreateViewOp)
    def create_view(operations, operation):
        operations.execute("CREATE VIEW %s AS %s" % (
            operation.target.name,
            operation.target.sqltext
        ))


    @Operations.implementation_for(DropViewOp)
    def drop_view(operations, operation):
        operations.execute("DROP VIEW %s" % operation.target.name)


    @Operations.implementation_for(CreateSPOp)
    def create_sp(operations, operation):
        operations.execute(
            "CREATE FUNCTION %s %s" % (
                operation.target.name, operation.target.sqltext
            )
        )


    @Operations.implementation_for(DropSPOp)
    def drop_sp(operations, operation):
        operations.execute("DROP FUNCTION %s" % operation.target.name)

All of the above code can be present anywhere within an application's
source tree; the only requirement is that when the ``env.py`` script is
invoked, it includes imports that ultimately call upon these classes
as well as the :meth:`.Operations.register_operation` and
:meth:`.Operations.implementation_for` sequences.

Create Initial Migrations
-------------------------

We can now illustrate how these objects look during use.  For the first step,
we'll create a new migration to create a "customer" table::

    $ alembic revision -m "create table"

We build the first revision as follows::

    """create table

    Revision ID: 3ab8b2dfb055
    Revises:
    Create Date: 2015-07-27 16:22:44.918507

    """

    # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
    revision = '3ab8b2dfb055'
    down_revision = None
    branch_labels = None
    depends_on = None

    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa


    def upgrade():
        op.create_table(
            "customer",
            sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
            sa.Column('name', sa.String),
            sa.Column('order_count', sa.Integer),
        )


    def downgrade():
        op.drop_table('customer')

For the second migration, we will create a view and a stored procedure
which act upon this table::

    $ alembic revision -m "create views/sp"

This migration will use the new directives::

    """create views/sp

    Revision ID: 28af9800143f
    Revises: 3ab8b2dfb055
    Create Date: 2015-07-27 16:24:03.589867

    """

    # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
    revision = '28af9800143f'
    down_revision = '3ab8b2dfb055'
    branch_labels = None
    depends_on = None

    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa

    from foo import ReplaceableObject

    customer_view = ReplaceableObject(
        "customer_view",
        "SELECT name, order_count FROM customer WHERE order_count > 0"
    )

    add_customer_sp = ReplaceableObject(
        "add_customer_sp(name varchar, order_count integer)",
        """
        RETURNS integer AS $$
        BEGIN
            insert into customer (name, order_count)
            VALUES (in_name, in_order_count);
        END;
        $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
        """
    )


    def upgrade():
        op.create_view(customer_view)
        op.create_sp(add_customer_sp)


    def downgrade():
        op.drop_view(customer_view)
        op.drop_sp(add_customer_sp)


We see the use of our new ``create_view()``, ``create_sp()``,
``drop_view()``, and ``drop_sp()`` directives.  Running these to "head"
we get the following (this includes an edited view of SQL emitted)::

    $ alembic upgrade 28af9800143

        RETURNS integer AS $$
        BEGIN
            insert into customer (name, order_count)
            VALUES (in_name, in_order_count);
        END;
        $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    INFO  [sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine] {}
    INFO  [sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine] UPDATE alembic_version SET version_num='28af9800143f' WHERE alembic_version.version_num = '3ab8b2dfb055'
    INFO  [sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine] {}
    INFO  [sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine] COMMIT

We see that our CREATE TABLE proceeded as well as the CREATE VIEW and CREATE
FUNCTION operations produced by our new directives.


Create Revision Migrations
--------------------------

Finally, we can illustrate how we would "revise" these objects.
Let's consider we added a new column ``email`` to our ``customer`` table::

    $ alembic revision -m "add email col"

The migration is::

    """add email col

    Revision ID: 191a2d20b025
    Revises: 28af9800143f
    Create Date: 2015-07-27 16:25:59.277326

    """

    # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
    revision = '191a2d20b025'
    down_revision = '28af9800143f'
    branch_labels = None
    depends_on = None

    from alembic import op
    import sqlalchemy as sa


    def upgrade():
        op.add_column("customer", sa.Column("email", sa.String()))


    def downgrade():
        op.drop_column("customer", "email")


We now need to recreate the ``customer_view`` view and the
``add_customer_sp`` function.   To include downgrade capability, we will
need to refer to the **previous** version of the construct; the
``replace_view()`` and ``replace_sp()`` operations we've created make
this possible, by allowing us to refer to a specific, previous revision.
the ``replaces`` and ``replace_with`` arguments accept a dot-separated
string, which refers to a revision number and an object name, such
as ``"28af9800143f.customer_view"``.  The ``ReversibleOp`` class makes use
of the :meth:`.Operations.get_context` method to locate the version file
we refer to::

    $ alembic revision -m "update views/sp"

The migration::

    """update views/sp

    Revision ID: 199028bf9856
    Revises: 191a2d20b025
    Create Date: 2015-07-27 16:26:31.344504

Don't Generate Empty Migrations with Autogenerate
=================================================

A common request is to have the ``alembic revision --autogenerate`` command not
actually generate a revision file if no changes to the schema is detected.  Using
the :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.process_revision_directives`
hook, this is straightforward; place a ``process_revision_directives``
hook in :meth:`.MigrationContext.configure` which removes the
single :class:`.MigrationScript` directive if it is empty of
any operations::


    def run_migrations_online():

        # ...

        def process_revision_directives(context, revision, directives):
            if config.cmd_opts.autogenerate:
                script = directives[0]
                if script.upgrade_ops.is_empty():
                    directives[:] = []


        # connectable = ...

        with connectable.connect() as connection:
            context.configure(
                connection=connection,
                target_metadata=target_metadata,
                process_revision_directives=process_revision_directives
            )

            with context.begin_transaction():
                context.run_migrations()

Don't emit DROP INDEX when the table is to be dropped as well
=============================================================

MySQL may complain when dropping an index that is against a column
that also has a foreign key constraint on it.   If the table is to be dropped
in any case, the DROP INDEX isn't necessary.  This recipe will process the set
of autogenerate directives such that all :class:`.DropIndexOp` directives
are removed against tables that themselves are to be dropped::

    def run_migrations_online():

        # ...

        from alembic.operations import ops

        def process_revision_directives(context, revision, directives):
            script = directives[0]

            # process both "def upgrade()", "def downgrade()"
            for directive in (script.upgrade_ops, script.downgrade_ops):

                # make a set of tables that are being dropped within
                # the migration function
                tables_dropped = set()
                for op in directive.ops:
                    if isinstance(op, ops.DropTableOp):
                        tables_dropped.add((op.table_name, op.schema))

                # now rewrite the list of "ops" such that DropIndexOp
                # is removed for those tables.   Needs a recursive function.
                directive.ops = list(
                    _filter_drop_indexes(directive.ops, tables_dropped)
                )

        def _filter_drop_indexes(directives, tables_dropped):
            # given a set of (tablename, schemaname) to be dropped, filter
            # out DropIndexOp from the list of directives and yield the result.

            for directive in directives:
                # ModifyTableOps is a container of ALTER TABLE types of
                # commands.  process those in place recursively.
                if isinstance(directive, ops.ModifyTableOps) and \
                        (directive.table_name, directive.schema) in tables_dropped:
                    directive.ops = list(
                        _filter_drop_indexes(directive.ops, tables_dropped)
                    )

                    # if we emptied out the directives, then skip the
                    # container altogether.
                    if not directive.ops:
                        continue
                elif isinstance(directive, ops.DropIndexOp) and \
                        (directive.table_name, directive.schema) in tables_dropped:
                    # we found a target DropIndexOp.   keep looping
                    continue

                # otherwise if not filtered, yield out the directive
                yield directive

        # connectable = ...

        with connectable.connect() as connection:
            context.configure(
                connection=connection,
                target_metadata=target_metadata,
                process_revision_directives=process_revision_directives
            )

            with context.begin_transaction():
                context.run_migrations()


Whereas autogenerate, when dropping two tables with a foreign key and
an index, would previously generate something like::

    def downgrade():
        # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
        op.drop_index(op.f('ix_b_aid'), table_name='b')
        op.drop_table('b')
        op.drop_table('a')
        # ### end Alembic commands ###

With the above rewriter, it generates as::

    def downgrade():
        # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
        op.drop_table('b')
        op.drop_table('a')
        # ### end Alembic commands ###



Don't emit CREATE TABLE statements for Views
============================================

It is sometimes convenient to create :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` instances for views
so that they can be queried using normal SQLAlchemy techniques. Unfortunately this
causes Alembic to treat them as tables in need of creation and to generate spurious
``create_table()`` operations. This is easily fixable by flagging such Tables and using the
:paramref:`~.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_object` hook to exclude them::

    my_view = Table('my_view', metadata, autoload=True, info=dict(is_view=True))    # Flag this as a view

Then define ``include_object`` as::

    def include_object(object, name, type_, reflected, compare_to):
        """
        Exclude views from Alembic's consideration.
        """

        return not object.info.get('is_view', False)

Finally, in ``env.py`` pass your ``include_object`` as a keyword argument to :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure`.

.. _multiple_environments:

Run Multiple Alembic Environments from one .ini file
====================================================

Long before Alembic had the "multiple bases" feature described in :ref:`multiple_bases`,
projects had a need to maintain more than one Alembic version history in a single
project, where these version histories are completely independent of each other
and each refer to their own alembic_version table, either across multiple databases,
schemas, or namespaces.  A simple approach was added to support this, the
``--name`` flag on the commandline.

First, one would create an alembic.ini file of this form::

    [DEFAULT]
    # all defaults shared between environments go here

    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://scott:tiger@hostname/mydatabase


    [schema1]
    # path to env.py and migration scripts for schema1
    script_location = myproject/revisions/schema1

    [schema2]
    # path to env.py and migration scripts for schema2
    script_location = myproject/revisions/schema2

    [schema3]
    # path to env.py and migration scripts for schema3
    script_location = myproject/revisions/db2

    # this schema uses a different database URL as well
    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://scott:tiger@hostname/myotherdatabase


Above, in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section we set up a default database URL.
Then we create three sections corresponding to different revision lineages
in our project.   Each of these directories would have its own ``env.py``
and set of versioning files.   Then when we run the ``alembic`` command,
we simply give it the name of the configuration we want to use::

    alembic --name schema2 revision -m "new rev for schema 2" --autogenerate

Above, the ``alembic`` command makes use of the configuration in ``[schema2]``,
populated with defaults from the ``[DEFAULT]`` section.

The above approach can be automated by creating a custom front-end to the
Alembic commandline as well.
