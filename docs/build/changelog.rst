    :version: 1.0.8
    :include_notes_from: unreleased

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.7
    :released: January 25, 2019

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, autogenerate
       :tickets: 529

       Fixed issue in new comment support where autogenerated Python code
       for comments wasn't using ``repr()`` thus causing issues with
       quoting.  Pull request courtesy Damien Garaud.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.6
    :released: January 13, 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, operations
        :tickets: 422

        Added Table and Column level comments for supported backends.
        New methods :meth:`.Operations.create_table_comment` and
        :meth:`.Operations.drop_table_comment` are added.  A new arguments
        :paramref:`.Operations.alter_column.comment` and
        :paramref:`.Operations.alter_column.existing_comment` are added to
        :meth:`.Operations.alter_column`.   Autogenerate support is also added
        to ensure comment add/drops from tables and columns are generated as well
        as that :meth:`.Operations.create_table`, :meth:`.Operations.add_column`
        both include the comment field from the source :class:`.Table`
        or :class:`.Column` object.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.5
    :released: November 27, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 507

        Resolved remaining Python 3 deprecation warnings, covering
        the use of inspect.formatargspec() with a vendored version
        copied from the Python standard library, importing
        collections.abc above Python 3.3 when testing against abstract
        base classes, fixed one occurrence of log.warn(), as well as a few
        invalid escape sequences.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.4
    :released: November 27, 2018

    .. change::
       :tags: change

       Code hosting has been moved to GitHub, at
       https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic.  Additionally, the
       main Alembic website documentation URL is now
       https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.3
    :released: November 14, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 516

       Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`513`, where the logic to consume
       ``mssql_include`` was not correctly interpreting the case where the flag
       was not present, breaking the ``op.create_index`` directive for SQL Server
       as a whole.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.2
    :released: October 31, 2018

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, autogenerate
       :tickets: 515

       The ``system=True`` flag on :class:`.Column`, used primarily in conjunction
       with the Postgresql "xmin" column, now renders within the autogenerate
       render process, allowing the column to be excluded from DDL.  Additionally,
       adding a system=True column to a model will produce no autogenerate diff as
       this column is implicitly present in the database.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, mssql
       :tickets: 513

       Fixed issue where usage of the SQL Server ``mssql_include`` option within a
       :meth:`.Operations.create_index` would raise a KeyError, as the additional
       column(s) need to be added to the table object used by the construct
       internally.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.1
    :released: October 17, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, commands
        :tickets: 497

        Fixed an issue where revision descriptions were essentially
        being formatted twice. Any revision description that contained
        characters like %, writing output to stdout will fail because
        the call to config.print_stdout attempted to format any
        additional args passed to the function.
        This fix now only applies string formatting if any args are provided
        along with the output text.

    .. change::
       :tags: bug, autogenerate
       :tickets: 512

       Fixed issue where removed method ``union_update()`` was used when a
       customized :class:`.MigrationScript` instance included entries in the
       ``.imports`` data member, raising an AttributeError.


.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.0
    :released: July 13, 2018
    :released: July 13, 2018
    :released: July 13, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, general
        :tickets: 491

        For Alembic 1.0, Python 2.6 / 3.3 support is being dropped, allowing a
        fixed setup.py to be built as well as universal wheels.  Pull request
        courtesy Hugo.




    .. change::
        :tags: feature, general

        With the 1.0 release, Alembic's minimum SQLAlchemy support version
        moves to 0.9.0, previously 0.7.9.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, batch
        :tickets: 502

        Fixed issue in batch where dropping a primary key column, then adding it
        back under the same name but without the primary_key flag, would not remove
        it from the existing PrimaryKeyConstraint.  If a new PrimaryKeyConstraint
        is added, it is used as-is, as was the case before.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.10
    :released: June 29, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate

        The "op.drop_constraint()" directive will now render using ``repr()`` for
        the schema name, in the same way that "schema" renders for all the other op
        directives.  Pull request courtesy Denis Kataev.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate
        :tickets: 494

        Added basic capabilities for external dialects to support rendering of
        "nested" types, like arrays, in a manner similar to that of the Postgresql
        dialect.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate

        Fixed issue where "autoincrement=True" would not render for a column that
        specified it, since as of SQLAlchemy 1.1 this is no longer the default
        value for "autoincrement".  Note the behavior only takes effect against the
        SQLAlchemy 1.1.0 and higher; for pre-1.1 SQLAlchemy, "autoincrement=True"
        does not render as was the case before. Pull request courtesy  Elad Almos.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.9
    :released: March 22, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, commands
        :tickets: 481

        Added new flag ``--indicate-current`` to the ``alembic history`` command.
        When listing versions, it will include the token "(current)" to indicate
        the given version is a current head in the target database.  Pull request
        courtesy Kazutaka Mise.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate, mysql
        :tickets: 455

        The fix for :ticket:`455` in version 0.9.6 involving MySQL server default
        comparison was entirely non functional, as the test itself was also broken
        and didn't reveal that it wasn't working. The regular expression to compare
        server default values like CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to current_timestamp() is
        repaired.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql, autogenerate
        :tickets: 483

        Fixed bug where MySQL server default comparisons were basically not working
        at all due to incorrect regexp added in :ticket:`455`.  Also accommodates
        for MariaDB 10.2 quoting differences in reporting integer based server
        defaults.




    .. change::
        :tags: bug, operations, mysql
        :tickets: 487

        Fixed bug in ``op.drop_constraint()`` for MySQL where
        quoting rules would not be applied to the constraint name.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.8
    :released: February 16, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, runtime
        :tickets: 482

        Fixed bug where the :meth:`.Script.as_revision_number` method
        did not accommodate for the 'heads' identifier, which in turn
        caused the :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_head_revisions`
        and :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_revision_argument` methods
        to be not usable when multiple heads were present.
        The :meth:.`EnvironmentContext.get_head_revisions` method returns
        a tuple in all cases as documented.



    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql, autogenerate
        :tickets: 478

        Fixed bug where autogenerate of :class:`.ExcludeConstraint`
        would render a raw quoted name for a Column that has case-sensitive
        characters, which when invoked as an inline member of the Table
        would produce a stack trace that the quoted name is not found.
        An incoming Column object is now rendered as ``sa.column('name')``.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate
        :tickets: 468

        Fixed bug where the indexes would not be included in a
        migration that was dropping the owning table.   The fix
        now will also emit DROP INDEX for the indexes ahead of time,
        but more importantly will include CREATE INDEX in the
        downgrade migration.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 480

        Fixed the autogenerate of the module prefix
        when rendering the text_type parameter of
        postgresql.HSTORE, in much the same way that
        we do for ARRAY's type and JSON's text_type.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 479

        Added support for DROP CONSTRAINT to the MySQL Alembic
        dialect to support MariaDB 10.2 which now has real
        CHECK constraints.  Note this change does **not**
        add autogenerate support, only support for op.drop_constraint()
        to work.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.7
    :released: January 16, 2018

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate
        :tickets: 472

        Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`421` which would
        cause case-sensitive quoting rules to interfere with the
        comparison logic for index names, thus causing indexes to show
        as added for indexes that have case-sensitive names.   Works with
        SQLAlchemy 0.9 and later series.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql, autogenerate
        :tickets: 461

        Fixed bug where autogenerate would produce a DROP statement for the index
        implicitly created by a Postgresql EXCLUDE constraint, rather than skipping
        it as is the case for indexes implicitly generated by unique constraints.
        Makes use of SQLAlchemy 1.0.x's improved "duplicates index" metadata and
        requires at least SQLAlchemy version 1.0.x to function correctly.



.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.6
    :released: October 13, 2017

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, commands
        :tickets: 458

        Fixed a few Python3.6 deprecation warnings by replacing ``StopIteration``
        with ``return``, as well as using ``getfullargspec()`` instead of
        ``getargspec()`` under Python 3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, commands
        :tickets: 441

        An addition to :ticket:`441` fixed in 0.9.5, we forgot to also filter
        for the ``+`` sign in migration names which also breaks due to the relative
        migrations feature.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate
        :tickets: 442

        Fixed bug expanding upon the fix for
        :ticket:`85` which adds the correct module import to the
        "inner" type for an ``ARRAY`` type, the fix now accommodates for the
        generic ``sqlalchemy.types.ARRAY`` type added in SQLAlchemy 1.1,
        rendering the inner type correctly regardless of whether or not the
        Postgresql dialect is present.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mysql
        :tickets: 455

        Fixed bug where server default comparison of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP would fail
        on MariaDB 10.2 due to a change in how the function is
        represented by the database during reflection.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate

        Fixed bug where comparison of ``Numeric`` types would produce
        a difference if the Python-side ``Numeric`` inadvertently specified
        a non-None "scale" with a "precision" of None, even though this ``Numeric``
        type will pass over the "scale" argument when rendering. Pull request
        courtesy Ivan Mmelnychuk.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, commands
        :tickets: 447

        The ``alembic history`` command will now make use of the revision
        environment ``env.py`` unconditionally if the ``revision_environment``
        configuration flag is set to True.  Previously, the environment would
        only be invoked if the history specification were against a database-stored
        revision token.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, batch
        :tickets: 457

        The name of the temporary table in batch mode is now generated
        off of the original table name itself, to avoid conflicts for the
        unusual case of multiple batch operations running against the same
        database schema at the same time.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, autogenerate
        :tickets: 456

        A :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` can now render correctly if the
        ``link_to_name`` flag is set, as it will not attempt to resolve the name
        from a "key" in this case.  Additionally, the constraint will render
        as-is even if the remote column name isn't present on the referenced
        remote table.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, runtime, py3k
        :tickets: 449

        Reworked "sourceless" system to be fully capable of handling any
        combination of: Python2/3x, pep3149 or not, PYTHONOPTIMIZE or not,
        for locating and loading both env.py files as well as versioning files.
        This includes: locating files inside of ``__pycache__`` as well as listing
        out version files that might be only in ``versions/__pycache__``, deduplicating
        version files that may be in ``versions/__pycache__`` and ``versions/``
        at the same time, correctly looking for .pyc or .pyo files based on
        if pep488 is present or not. The latest Python3x deprecation warnings
        involving importlib are also corrected.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.5
    :released: August 9, 2017

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, commands
        :tickets: 441

        A :class:`.CommandError` is raised if the "--rev-id" passed to the
        :func:`.revision` command contains dashes or at-signs, as this interferes
        with the command notation used to locate revisions.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 424

        Added support for the dialect-specific keyword arguments
        to :meth:`.Operations.drop_index`.   This includes support for
        ``postgresql_concurrently`` and others.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, commands

        Fixed bug in timezone feature introduced in
        :ticket:`425` when the creation
        date in a revision file is calculated, to
        accommodate for timezone names that contain
        mixed-case characters in their name as opposed
        to all uppercase.  Pull request courtesy Nils
        Philippsen.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.4
    :released: July 31, 2017

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, runtime

      Added an additional attribute to the new
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.on_version_apply` API,
      :attr:`.MigrationInfo.up_revision_ids`, to accommodate for the uncommon
      case of the ``alembic stamp`` command being used to move from multiple
      branches down to a common branchpoint; there will be multiple
      "up" revisions in this one case.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.3
    :released: July 6, 2017

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, runtime

      Added a new callback hook
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.on_version_apply`,
      which allows user-defined code to be invoked each time an individual
      upgrade, downgrade, or stamp operation proceeds against a database.
      Pull request courtesy John Passaro.

    .. change:: 433
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 433

      Fixed bug where autogen comparison of a :class:`.Variant` datatype
      would not compare to the dialect level type for the "default"
      implementation of the :class:`.Variant`, returning the type as changed
      between database and table metadata.

    .. change:: 431
      :tags: bug, tests
      :tickets: 431

      Fixed unit tests to run correctly under the SQLAlchemy 1.0.x series
      prior to version 1.0.10 where a particular bug involving Postgresql
      exclude constraints was fixed.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.2
    :released: May 18, 2017

    .. change:: 429
      :tags: bug, mssql
      :tickets: 429

      Repaired :meth:`.Operations.rename_table` for SQL Server when the
      target table is in a remote schema, the schema name is omitted from
      the "new name" argument.

    .. change:: 425
      :tags: feature, commands
      :tickets: 425

      Added a new configuration option ``timezone``, a string timezone name
      that will be applied to the create date timestamp rendered
      inside the revision file as made availble to the ``file_template`` used
      to generate the revision filename.  Note this change adds the
      ``python-dateutil`` package as a dependency.

    .. change:: 421
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 421

      The autogenerate compare scheme now takes into account the name truncation
      rules applied by SQLAlchemy's DDL compiler to the names of the
      :class:`.Index` object, when these names are dynamically truncated
      due to a too-long identifier name.   As the identifier truncation is
      deterministic, applying the same rule to the metadata name allows
      correct comparison to the database-derived name.

    .. change:: 419
      :tags: bug environment
      :tickets: 419

      A warning is emitted when an object that's not a
      :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection` is passed to
      :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure`.  For the case of a
      :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` passed, the check for "in transaction"
      introduced in version 0.9.0 has been relaxed to work in the case of an
      attribute error, as some users appear to be passing an
      :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` and not a
      :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection`.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.1
    :released: March 1, 2017

    .. change:: 417
      :tags: bug, commands
      :tickets: 417, 369

      An adjustment to the bug fix for :ticket:`369` to accommodate for
      env.py scripts that use an enclosing transaction distinct from the
      one that the context provides, so that the check for "didn't commit
      the transaction" doesn't trigger in this scenario.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.9.0
    :released: February 28, 2017

    .. change:: 38
      :tags: feature, autogenerate
      :tickets: 38

      The :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.target_metadata` parameter
      may now be optionally specified as a sequence of :class:`.MetaData`
      objects instead of a single :class:`.MetaData` object.  The
      autogenerate process will process the sequence of :class:`.MetaData`
      objects in order.

    .. change:: 369
      :tags: bug, commands
      :tickets: 369

      A :class:`.CommandError` is now raised when a migration file opens
      a database transaction and does not close/commit/rollback, when
      the backend database or environment options also specify transactional_ddl
      is False.   When transactional_ddl is not in use, Alembic doesn't
      close any transaction so a transaction opened by a migration file
      will cause the following migrations to fail to apply.

    .. change:: 413
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, mysql
      :tickets: 413

      The ``autoincrement=True`` flag is now rendered within the
      :meth:`.Operations.alter_column` operation if the source column indicates
      that this flag should be set to True.  The behavior is sensitive to
      the SQLAlchemy version in place, as the "auto" default option is new
      in SQLAlchemy 1.1.  When the source column indicates autoincrement
      as True or "auto", the flag will render as True if the original column
      contextually indicates that it should have "autoincrement" keywords,
      and when the source column explcitly sets it to False, this is also
      rendered.  The behavior is intended to preserve the AUTO_INCREMENT flag
      on MySQL as the column is fully recreated on this backend.  Note that this
      flag does **not** support alteration of a column's "autoincrement" status,
      as this is not portable across backends.

    .. change:: 411
      :tags: bug, postgresql
      :tickets: 411

      Fixed bug where Postgresql JSON/JSONB types rendered on SQLAlchemy
      1.1 would render the "astext_type" argument which defaults to
      the ``Text()`` type without the module prefix, similarly to the
      issue with ARRAY fixed in :ticket:`85`.

    .. change:: 85
      :tags: bug, postgresql
      :tickets: 85

      Fixed bug where Postgresql ARRAY type would not render the import prefix
      for the inner type; additionally, user-defined renderers take place
      for the inner type as well as the outer type.  Pull request courtesy
      Paul Brackin.

    .. change:: process_revision_directives_command
      :tags: feature, autogenerate

      Added a keyword argument ``process_revision_directives`` to the
      :func:`.command.revision` API call.  This function acts in the
      same role as the environment-level
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.process_revision_directives`,
      and allows API use of the
      command to drop in an ad-hoc directive process function.  This
      function can be used among other things to place a complete
      :class:`.MigrationScript` structure in place.

    .. change:: 412
      :tags: feature, postgresql
      :tickets: 412

      Added support for Postgresql EXCLUDE constraints, including the
      operation directive :meth:`.Operations.create_exclude_constraints`
      as well as autogenerate render support for the ``ExcludeConstraint``
      object as present in a ``Table``.  Autogenerate detection for an EXCLUDE
      constraint added or removed to/from an existing table is **not**
      implemented as the SQLAlchemy Postgresql dialect does not yet support
      reflection of EXCLUDE constraints.

      Additionally, unknown constraint types now warn when
      encountered within an autogenerate action rather than raise.

    .. change:: fk_schema_compare
      :tags: bug, operations

      Fixed bug in :func:`.ops.create_foreign_key` where the internal table
      representation would not be created properly if the foriegn key referred
      to a table in a different schema of the same name.  Pull request
      courtesy Konstantin Lebedev.

    .. change:: 406
      :tags: bug, versioning
      :tickets: 406

      The alembic_version table, when initially created, now establishes a
      primary key constraint on the "version_num" column, to suit database
      engines that don't support tables without primary keys.   This behavior
      can be controlled using the parameter
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.version_table_pk`.  Note that
      this change only applies to the initial creation of the alembic_version
      table; it does not impact any existing alembic_version table already
      present.

    .. change:: 402
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 402

      Fixed bug where doing ``batch_op.drop_constraint()`` against the
      primary key constraint would fail to remove the "primary_key" flag
      from the column, resulting in the constraint being recreated.

    .. change:: update_uq_dedupe
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, oracle

      Adjusted the logic originally added for :ticket:`276` that detects MySQL
      unique constraints which are actually unique indexes to be generalized
      for any dialect that has this behavior, for SQLAlchemy version 1.0 and
      greater.  This is to allow for upcoming SQLAlchemy support for unique
      constraint reflection for Oracle, which also has no dedicated concept of
      "unique constraint" and instead establishes a unique index.

      Batch mode will not use CAST() to copy data if type_ is given, however
      the basic type affinity matches that of the existing type.  This to
      avoid SQLite's CAST of TIMESTAMP which results in truncation of the
      data, in those cases where the user needs to add redundant type_ for
      other reasons.

      Fixed bug where usage of a custom TypeDecorator which returns a

      :tickets: 336

      Fixed bug where upgrading to the head of a branch which is already
      present would fail, only if that head were also the dependency
      of a different branch that is also upgraded, as the revision system
      would see this as trying to go in the wrong direction.   The check
      here has been refined to distinguish between same-branch revisions
      out of order vs. movement along sibling branches.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, versioning
      :tickets: 379

      Adjusted the version traversal on downgrade
      such that we can downgrade to a version that is a dependency for
      a version in a different branch, *without* needing to remove that
      dependent version as well.  Previously, the target version would be
      seen as a "merge point" for it's normal up-revision as well as the
      dependency.  This integrates with the changes for :ticket:`377`
      and :ticket:`378` to improve treatment of branches with dependencies
      overall.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, versioning
      :tickets: 377

      Fixed bug where a downgrade to a version that is also a dependency
      to a different branch would fail, as the system attempted to treat
      this as an "unmerge" of a merge point, when in fact it doesn't have
      the other side of the merge point available for update.

    .. change::

      :tickets: 378

      Fixed bug where the "alembic current" command wouldn't show a revision
      as a current head if it were also a dependency of a version in a
      different branch that's also applied.   Extra logic is added to
      extract "implied" versions of different branches from the top-level
      versions listed in the alembic_version table.

      Fixed bug where a repr() or str() of a Script object would fail

      Fixed bug in autogen where if the DB connection sends the default
      schema as "None", this "None" would be removed from the list of
      schemas to check if include_schemas were set.  This could possibly
      impact using include_schemas with SQLite.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch

      Small adjustment made to the batch handling for reflected CHECK
      constraints to accommodate for SQLAlchemy 1.1 now reflecting these.
      Batch mode still does not support CHECK constraints from the reflected
      table as these can't be easily differentiated from the ones created
      by types such as Boolean.

      :tickets: 365

      Added a fix to Postgresql server default comparison which first checks
      if the text of the default is identical to the original, before attempting
      to actually run the default.  This accomodates for default-generation
      functions that generate a new value each time such as a uuid function.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 354

      Repaired batch migration support for "schema" types which generate
      constraints, in particular the ``Boolean`` datatype which generates
      a CHECK constraint.  Previously, an alter column operation with this
      type would fail to correctly accommodate for the CHECK constraint
      on change both from and to this type.  In the former case the operation
      would fail entirely, in the latter, the CHECK constraint would
      not get generated.  Both of these issues are repaired.

      :tickets: 355

      Changing a schema type such as ``Boolean`` to a non-schema type would
      emit a drop constraint operation which emits ``NotImplementedError`` for
      the MySQL dialect.  This drop constraint operation is now skipped when
      the constraint originates from a schema type.

      A major improvement to the hash id generation function, which for some
      reason used an awkward arithmetic formula against uuid4() that produced
      values that tended to start with the digits 1-4.  Replaced with a
      simple substring approach which provides an even distribution.  Pull

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 345

      Batch mode generates a FOREIGN KEY constraint that is self-referential
      using the ultimate table name, rather than ``_alembic_batch_temp``.
      When the table is renamed from ``_alembic_batch_temp`` back to the
      original name, the FK now points to the right name.  This
      will **not** work if referential integrity is being enforced (eg. SQLite
      "PRAGMA FOREIGN_KEYS=ON") since the original table is dropped and
      the new table then renamed to that name, however this is now consistent
      with how foreign key constraints on **other** tables already operate
      with batch mode; these don't support batch mode if referential integrity
      is enabled in any case.

    .. change::

      :tickets: 341

      Added a type-level comparator that distinguishes :class:`.Integer`,
      :class:`.BigInteger`, and :class:`.SmallInteger` types and
      dialect-specific types; these all have "Integer" affinity so previously
      all compared as the same.

      Adjusted the rendering for index expressions such that a :class:`.Column`
      object present in the source :class:`.Index` will not be rendered

      Fixed an 0.8 regression whereby the "imports" dictionary member of
      the autogen context was removed; this collection is documented in the
      "render custom type" documentation as a place to add new imports.
      The member is now known as

    .. change::

      :tickets: 333

      Fixed bug in batch mode where a table that had pre-existing indexes
      would create the same index on the new table with the same name,
      which on SQLite produces a naming conflict as index names are in a
      global namespace on that backend.   Batch mode now defers the production
      of both existing and new indexes until after the entire table transfer
      operation is complete, which also means those indexes no longer take
      effect during the INSERT from SELECT section as well; the indexes
      are applied in a single step afterwards.

      Fixed issue in PG server default comparison where model-side defaults
      configured with Python unicode literals would leak the "u" character
      from a ``repr()`` into the SQL used for comparison, creating an invalid

      repurposes the autogenerate Python rendering feature to get a quoted
      version of a plain string default.

      Added workaround in new foreign key option detection feature for
      MySQL's consideration of the "RESTRICT" option being the default,
      for which no value is reported from the database; the MySQL impl now
      corrects for when the model reports RESTRICT but the database reports
      nothing.   A similar rule is in the default FK comparison to accommodate
      for the default "NO ACTION" setting being present in the model but not
      necessarily reported by the database, or vice versa.

      A custom :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.process_revision_directives`

      and :class:`.DowngradeOps` containers that will be generated as Python
      code even when the ``--autogenerate`` flag is False; provided that
      ``revision_environment=True``, the full render operation will be run
      even in "offline" mode.

      Fixed a regression 0.8 whereby the "multidb" environment template
      failed to produce independent migration script segments for the
      output template.  This was due to the reorganization of the script
      rendering system for 0.8.  To accommodate this change, the
      :class:`.MigrationScript` structure will in the case of multiple
      calls to :meth:`.MigrationContext.run_migrations` produce lists
      for the :attr:`.MigrationScript.upgrade_ops` and
      :attr:`.MigrationScript.downgrade_ops` attributes; each :class:`.UpgradeOps`
      and :class:`.DowngradeOps` instance keeps track of its own
      ``upgrade_token`` and ``downgrade_token``, and each are rendered
      individually.

      attributes of :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` objects on
      SQLAlchemy backends that support these on reflection
      (as of SQLAlchemy 1.0.8 currently Postgresql for all four,
      MySQL for ``ondelete`` and  ``onupdate`` only).   A constraint object
      that modifies these values will be reported as a "diff" and come out
      as a drop/create of the constraint with the modified values.
      The fields are ignored for backends which don't reflect these
      attributes (as of SQLA 1.0.8 this includes SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server,
      others).

      established at the command line level rather than having to edit
      the file after the fact. ``depends_on`` identifiers may also be
      specified as branch names at the command line or directly within
      the migration file. The values may be specified as partial
      revision numbers from the command line which will be resolved to
      full revision numbers in the output file.

      :tags: change, operations

      A range of positional argument names have been changed to be
      clearer and more consistent across methods within the
      :class:`.Operations` namespace.   The most prevalent form of name change
      is that the descriptive names ``constraint_name`` and ``table_name``
      are now used where previously the name ``name`` would be used.
      This is in support of the newly modularized and extensible system of
      operation objects in :mod:`alembic.operations.ops`.
      An argument translation layer is in place
      across the ``alembic.op`` namespace that will ensure that named
      argument calling styles that use the old names will continue to
      function by transparently translating to the new names,
      also emitting a warning.   This, along with the fact that these
      arguments are positional in any case and aren't normally
      passed with an explicit name, should ensure that the
      overwhelming majority of applications should be unaffected by this
      change.   The *only* applications that are impacted are those that:

      1. use the :class:`.Operations` object directly in some way, rather
         than calling upon the ``alembic.op`` namespace, and

      2. invoke the methods on :class:`.Operations` using named keyword
         arguments for positional arguments like ``table_name``,
         ``constraint_name``, etc., which commonly were named ``name``
         as of 0.7.6.

      3. any application that is using named keyword arguments in place
         of positional argument for the recently added
         :class:`.BatchOperations` object may also be affected.

      The naming changes are documented as "versionchanged" for 0.8.0:

      * :meth:`.BatchOperations.create_check_constraint`
      * :meth:`.BatchOperations.create_foreign_key`
      * :meth:`.BatchOperations.create_index`

      The internal system for autogenerate been reworked to build upon
      the extensible system of operation objects present in

      a full object graph representing a list of migration scripts to
      be written as well as operation objects that will render all the
      Python code within them; a new hook
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.process_revision_directives`
      allows end-user code to fully customize what autogenerate will do,
      including not just full manipulation of the Python steps to take
      but also what file or files will be written and where.  Additionally,
      autogenerate is now extensible as far as database objects compared
      and rendered into scripts; any new operation directive can also be
      registered into a series of hooks that allow custom database/model
      comparison functions to run as well as to render new operation
      directives into autogenerate scripts.

      Fixed bug where in the erroneous case that alembic_version contains

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.7
    :released: July 22, 2015

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, versioning
      :tickets: 310

      Fixed critical issue where a complex series of branches/merges would
      bog down the iteration algorithm working over redundant nodes for
      millions of cycles.   An internal adjustment has been
      made so that duplicate nodes are skipped within this iteration.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, batch
      :tickets: 305

      Implemented support for :meth:`.BatchOperations.create_primary_key`
      and :meth:`.BatchOperations.create_check_constraint`. Additionally,
      table keyword arguments are copied from the original reflected table,
      such as the "mysql_engine" keyword argument.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, environment
      :tickets: 300

      The :meth:`.MigrationContext.stamp` method, added as part of the
      versioning refactor in 0.7 as a more granular version of
      :func:`.command.stamp`, now includes the "create the alembic_version
      table if not present" step in the same way as the command version,
      which was previously omitted.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 298

      Fixed bug where foreign key options including "onupdate",
      "ondelete" would not render within the ``op.create_foreign_key()``
      directive, even though they render within a full
      ``ForeignKeyConstraint`` directive.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, tests

      Repaired warnings that occur when running unit tests against
      SQLAlchemy 1.0.5 or greater involving the "legacy_schema_aliasing"
      flag.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.6
    :released: May 5, 2015

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, versioning
      :tickets: 297

      Fixed bug where the case of multiple mergepoints that all
      have the identical set of ancestor revisions would fail to be
      upgradable, producing an assertion failure.   Merge points were
      previously assumed to always require at least an UPDATE in
      alembic_revision from one of the previous revs to the new one,
      however in this case, if one of the mergepoints has already
      been reached, the remaining mergepoints have no row to UPDATE therefore
      they must do an INSERT of their target version.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, autogenerate
      :tickets: 296

      Added support for type comparison functions to be not just per
      environment, but also present on the custom types themselves, by
      supplying a method ``compare_against_backend``.
      Added a new documentation section :ref:`compare_types` describing
      type comparison fully.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, operations
      :tickets: 255

      Added a new option
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.literal_binds`, which
      will pass the ``literal_binds`` flag into the compilation of SQL
      constructs when using "offline" mode.  This has the effect that
      SQL objects like inserts, updates, deletes as well as textual
      statements sent using ``text()`` will be compiled such that the dialect
      will attempt to render literal values "inline" automatically.
      Only a subset of types is typically supported; the
      :meth:`.Operations.inline_literal` construct remains as the construct
      used to force a specific literal representation of a value.
      The :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.literal_binds` flag
      is added to the "offline" section of the ``env.py`` files generated
      in new environments.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 289

      Fully implemented the
      :paramref:`~.Operations.batch_alter_table.copy_from` parameter for
      batch mode, which previously was not functioning.  This allows
      "batch mode" to be usable in conjunction with ``--sql``.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 287

      Repaired support for the :meth:`.BatchOperations.create_index`
      directive, which was mis-named internally such that the operation
      within a batch context could not proceed.   The create index
      operation will proceed as part of a larger "batch table recreate"
      operation only if
      :paramref:`~.Operations.batch_alter_table.recreate` is set to
      "always", or if the batch operation includes other instructions that
      require a table recreate.


.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.5
    :released: March 19, 2015

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 266

      The ``--autogenerate`` option is not valid when used in conjunction
      with "offline" mode, e.g. ``--sql``.  This now raises a ``CommandError``,
      rather than failing more deeply later on.  Pull request courtesy
      Johannes Erdfelt.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, operations, mssql
      :tickets: 284

      Fixed bug where the mssql DROP COLUMN directive failed to include
      modifiers such as "schema" when emitting the DDL.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, postgresql
      :tickets: 282

      Postgresql "functional" indexes are necessarily skipped from the
      autogenerate process, as the SQLAlchemy backend currently does not
      support reflection of these structures.   A warning is emitted
      both from the SQLAlchemy backend as well as from the Alembic
      backend for Postgresql when such an index is detected.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, mysql
      :tickets: 276

      Fixed bug where MySQL backend would report dropped unique indexes
      and/or constraints as both at the same time.  This is because
      MySQL doesn't actually have a "unique constraint" construct that
      reports differently than a "unique index", so it is present in both
      lists.  The net effect though is that the MySQL backend will report
      a dropped unique index/constraint as an index in cases where the object
      was first created as a unique constraint, if no other information
      is available to make the decision.  This differs from other backends
      like Postgresql which can report on unique constraints and
      unique indexes separately.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, commands
      :tickets: 269

      Fixed bug where using a partial revision identifier as the
      "starting revision" in ``--sql`` mode in a downgrade operation
      would fail to resolve properly.

      As a side effect of this change, the
      :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_starting_revision_argument`
      method will return the "starting" revision in its originally-
      given "partial" form in all cases, whereas previously when
      running within the :meth:`.command.stamp` command, it would have
      been resolved to a full number before passing it to the
      :class:`.EnvironmentContext`.  The resolution of this value to
      a real revision number has basically been moved to a more fundamental
      level within the offline migration process.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, commands

      Added a new feature :attr:`.Config.attributes`, to help with the use
      case of sharing state such as engines and connections on the outside
      with a series of Alembic API calls; also added a new cookbook section
      to describe this simple but pretty important use case.

      .. seealso::

          :ref:`connection_sharing`

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, environment

      The format of the default ``env.py`` script has been refined a bit;
      it now uses context managers not only for the scope of the transaction,
      but also for connectivity from the starting engine.  The engine is also
      now called a "connectable" in support of the use case of an external
      connection being passed in.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, versioning
      :tickets: 267

      Added support for "alembic stamp" to work when given "heads" as an
      argument, when multiple heads are present.

    :released: January 12, 2015

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, postgresql
      :tickets: 241

      Repaired issue where a server default specified without ``text()``
      that represented a numeric or floating point (e.g. with decimal places)
      value would fail in the Postgresql-specific check for "compare server
      default"; as PG accepts the value with quotes in the table specification,
      it's still valid.  Pull request courtesy Dimitris Theodorou.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 259

      The rendering of a :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.ForeignKeyConstraint`
      will now ensure that the names of the source and target columns are
      the database-side name of each column, and not the value of the
      ``.key`` attribute as may be set only on the Python side.
      This is because Alembic generates the DDL for constraints
      as standalone objects without the need to actually refer to an in-Python
      :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` object, so there's no step that
      would resolve these Python-only key names to database column names.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 260

      Fixed bug in foreign key autogenerate where if the in-Python table
      used custom column keys (e.g. using the ``key='foo'`` kwarg to
      ``Column``), the comparison of existing foreign keys to those specified
      in the metadata would fail, as the reflected table would not have
      these keys available which to match up.  Foreign key comparison for
      autogenerate now ensures it's looking at the database-side names
      of the columns in all cases; this matches the same functionality
      within unique constraints and indexes.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 261

      Fixed issue in autogenerate type rendering where types that belong
      to modules that have the name "sqlalchemy" in them would be mistaken
      as being part of the ``sqlalchemy.`` namespace.  Pull req courtesy
      Bartosz Burclaf.

      Fixed regression in new versioning system where upgrade / history
      operation would fail on AttributeError if no version files were
      present at all.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.2

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, sqlite, autogenerate

      Adjusted the SQLite backend regarding autogen of unique constraints
      to work fully with the current SQLAlchemy 1.0, which now will report
      on UNIQUE constraints that have no name.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 254

      Fixed bug in batch where if the target table contained multiple
      foreign keys to the same target table, the batch mechanics would
      fail with a "table already exists" error.  Thanks for the help
      on this from Lucas Kahlert.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mysql
      :tickets: 251

      Fixed an issue where the MySQL routine to skip foreign-key-implicit
      indexes would also catch unnamed unique indexes, as they would be
      named after the column and look like the FK indexes.  Pull request
      courtesy Johannes Erdfelt.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mssql, oracle
      :tickets: 253

      Repaired a regression in both the MSSQL and Oracle dialects whereby
      the overridden ``_exec()`` method failed to return a value, as is
      needed now in the 0.7 series.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.7.1
    :released: December 3, 2014

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch

      The ``render_as_batch`` flag was inadvertently hardcoded to ``True``,
      so all autogenerates were spitting out batch mode...this has been
      fixed so that batch mode again is only when selected in env.py.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, autogenerate
      :tickets: 178

      Support for autogenerate of FOREIGN KEY constraints has been added.
      These are delivered within the autogenerate process in the same
      manner as UNIQUE constraints, including ``include_object`` support.
      Big thanks to Ann Kamyshnikova for doing the heavy lifting here.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, batch

      Added :paramref:`~.Operations.batch_alter_table.naming_convention`
      argument to :meth:`.Operations.batch_alter_table`, as this is necessary
      in order to drop foreign key constraints; these are often unnamed
      on the target database, and in the case that they are named, SQLAlchemy
      is as of the 0.9 series not including these names yet.

      .. seealso::

        :ref:`dropping_sqlite_foreign_keys`

      request courtesy Malte Marquarding.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, batch
      :tickets: 249

      Repaired the inspection, copying and rendering of CHECK constraints
      and so-called "schema" types such as Boolean, Enum within the batch
      copy system; the CHECK constraint will not be "doubled" when the table is
      copied, and additionally the inspection of the CHECK constraint for
      its member columns will no longer fail with an attribute error.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, batch

      Added two new arguments
      :paramref:`.Operations.batch_alter_table.reflect_args`
      and :paramref:`.Operations.batch_alter_table.reflect_kwargs`, so that
      arguments may be passed directly to suit the
      :class:`~.sqlalchemy.schema.Table`
      object that will be reflected.

      :tags: feature, versioning
      :tickets: 167

      The "multiple heads / branches" feature has now landed.  This is
      by far the most significant change Alembic has seen since its inception;
      while the workflow of most commands hasn't changed, and the format
      of version files and the ``alembic_version`` table are unchanged as well,
      a new suite of features opens up in the case where multiple version
      files refer to the same parent, or to the "base".  Merging of
      branches, operating across distinct named heads, and multiple
      independent bases are now all supported.   The feature incurs radical
      changes to the internals of versioning and traversal, and should be
      treated as "beta mode" for the next several subsequent releases
      within 0.7.

      .. seealso::

          :ref:`branches`

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, versioning
      :tickets: 124

      In conjunction with support for multiple independent bases, the
      specific version directories are now also configurable to include
      multiple, user-defined directories.   When multiple directories exist,
      the creation of a revision file with no down revision requires
      that the starting directory is indicated; the creation of subsequent
      revisions along that lineage will then automatically use that
      directory for new files.

      :tags: feature, operations, sqlite
      :tickets: 21

      Added "move and copy" workflow, where a table to be altered is copied to
      a new one with the new structure and the old one dropped, is now
      implemented for SQLite as well as all database backends in general
      using the new :meth:`.Operations.batch_alter_table` system.   This
      directive provides a table-specific operations context which gathers
      column- and constraint-level mutations specific to that table, and
      at the end of the context creates a new table combining the structure
      of the old one with the given changes, copies data from old table to new,
      and finally drops the old table,
      renaming the new one to the existing name.  This is required for
      fully featured SQLite migrations, as SQLite has very little support for the
      traditional ALTER directive.   The batch directive
      is intended to produce code that is still compatible with other databases,
      in that the "move and copy" process only occurs for SQLite by default,
      while still providing some level of sanity to SQLite's
      requirement by allowing multiple table mutation operations to
      proceed within one "move and copy" as well as providing explicit
      control over when this operation actually occurs.  The "move and copy"
      feature may be optionally applied to other backends as well, however
      dealing with referential integrity constraints from other tables must
      still be handled explicitly.

      Relative revision identifiers as used with ``alembic upgrade``,
      ``alembic downgrade`` and ``alembic history`` can be combined with
      specific revisions as well, e.g. ``alembic upgrade ae10+3``, to produce
      a migration target relative to the given exact version.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, commands
      :tickets: 248

      The ``alembic revision`` command accepts the ``--sql`` option to
      suit some very obscure use case where the ``revision_environment``
      flag is set up, so that ``env.py`` is run when ``alembic revision``
      is run even though autogenerate isn't specified.   As this flag is
      otherwise confusing, error messages are now raised if
      ``alembic revision`` is invoked with both ``--sql`` and
      ``--autogenerate`` or with ``--sql`` without
      ``revision_environment`` being set.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, postgresql
      :tickets: 247

      Added a rule for Postgresql to not render a "drop unique" and "drop index"
      given the same name; for now it is assumed that the "index" is the
      implicit one Postgreql generates.   Future integration with
      new SQLAlchemy 1.0 features will improve this to be more
      resilient.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 247

      A change in the ordering when columns and constraints are dropped;
      autogenerate will now place the "drop constraint" calls *before*
      the "drop column" calls, so that columns involved in those constraints
      still exist when the constraint is dropped.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, commands

      New commands added: ``alembic show``, ``alembic heads`` and
      ``alembic merge``.  Also, a new option ``--verbose`` has been
      added to  several informational commands, such as ``alembic history``,
      ``alembic current``, ``alembic branches``, and ``alembic heads``.
      ``alembic revision`` also contains several new options used
      within the new branch management system.    The output of commands has
      been altered in many cases to support new fields and attributes;
      the ``history`` command in particular now returns it's "verbose" output
      only if ``--verbose`` is sent; without this flag it reverts to it's
      older behavior of short line items (which was never changed in the docs).

    .. change::
      :tags: changed, commands

      The ``--head_only`` option to the ``alembic current`` command is
      deprecated; the ``current`` command now lists just the version numbers
      alone by default; use ``--verbose`` to get at additional output.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, config

      Added new argument :paramref:`.Config.config_args`, allows a dictionary
      of replacement variables to be passed which will serve as substitution
      values when an API-produced :class:`.Config` consumes the ``.ini``
      file.  Pull request courtesy Noufal Ibrahim.

      Fixed a variety of issues surrounding rendering of Python code that
      contains unicode literals.  The first is that the "quoted_name" construct
      that SQLAlchemy uses to represent table and column names as well
      as schema names does not ``repr()`` correctly on Py2K when the value
      contains unicode characters; therefore an explicit stringification is
      added to these.  Additionally, SQL expressions such as server defaults
      were not being generated in a unicode-safe fashion leading to decode
      errors if server defaults contained non-ascii characters.

      The :meth:`.Operations.add_column` directive will now additionally emit

      The :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` object is now returned when
      the :meth:`.Operations.create_table` method is used.  This ``Table``

      the :meth:`.Operations.bulk_insert` operation.

      :tickets: 199

      Added a workaround for SQLAlchemy issue #3023 (fixed in 0.9.5) where
      a column that's part of an explicit PrimaryKeyConstraint would not
      have its "nullable" flag set to False, thus producing a false
      autogenerate.  Also added a related correction to MySQL which will
      correct for MySQL's implicit server default of '0' when a NULL integer
      column is turned into a primary key column.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, mysql
      :tickets: 240

      Repaired issue related to the fix for #208 and others; a composite
      foreign key reported by MySQL would cause a KeyError as Alembic
      attempted to remove MySQL's implicitly generated indexes from the
      autogenerate list.

      The :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.version_table`
      and :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.version_table_schema`

      The default value of the
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.user_module_prefix`
      parameter is **no longer the same as the SQLAlchemy prefix**.
      When omitted, user-defined types will now use the ``__module__``

      Revision files are now written out using the ``'wb'`` modifier to
      ``open()``, since Mako reads the templates with ``'rb'``, thus preventing
      CRs from being doubled up as has been observed on windows.  The encoding
      of the output now defaults to 'utf-8', which can be configured using
      a newly added config file parameter ``output_encoding``.

      :tickets: 230

      Added support for use of the :class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.elements.quoted_name`
      construct when using the ``schema`` argument within operations.  This
      allows a name containing a dot to be fully quoted, as well as to
      provide configurable quoting on a per-name basis.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, postgresql
      :tickets: 73

      Added a routine by which the Postgresql Alembic dialect inspects
      the server default of INTEGER/BIGINT columns as they are reflected
      during autogenerate for the pattern ``nextval(<name>...)`` containing
      a potential sequence name, then queries ``pg_catalog`` to see if this
      sequence is "owned" by the column being reflected; if so, it assumes
      this is a SERIAL or BIGSERIAL column and the server default is
      omitted from the column reflection as well as any kind of
      server_default comparison or rendering, along with an INFO message
      in the logs indicating this has taken place. This allows SERIAL/BIGSERIAL
      columns to keep the SEQUENCE from being unnecessarily present within
      the autogenerate operation.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 197, 64, 196

      The system by which autogenerate renders expressions within
      a :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Index`, the ``server_default``
      of :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Column`, and the
      ``existing_server_default`` of
      :meth:`.Operations.alter_column` has been overhauled to anticipate
      arbitrary SQLAlchemy SQL constructs, such as ``func.somefunction()``,
      ``cast()``, ``desc()``, and others.   The system does not, as might
      be preferred, render the full-blown Python expression as originally
      created within the application's source code, as this would be exceedingly
      complex and difficult.  Instead, it renders the SQL expression against
      the target backend that's subject to the autogenerate, and then
      renders that SQL inside of a :func:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text`
      construct as a literal SQL string.  This approach still has the
      downside that the rendered SQL construct may not be backend-agnostic
      in all cases, so there is still a need for manual intervention in that
      small number of cases, but overall the majority of cases should work
      correctly now.  Big thanks to Carlos Rivera for pull requests and
      support on this.

      :tags: bug, autogenerate, mysql
      :tickets: 202

      This releases' "autogenerate index detection" bug, when a MySQL table
      includes an Index with the same name as a column, autogenerate reported
      it as an "add" even though its not; this is because we ignore reflected
      indexes of this nature due to MySQL creating them implicitly.  Indexes
      that are named the same as a column are now ignored on
      MySQL if we see that the backend is reporting that it already exists;
      this indicates that we can still detect additions of these indexes
      but not drops, as we cannot distinguish a backend index same-named
      as the column as one that is user generated or mysql-generated.

    .. change::

      Added new feature :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.transaction_per_migration`,
      which when True causes the BEGIN/COMMIT pair to incur for each migration

      The feature that keeps on giving, index/unique constraint autogenerate
      detection, has even more fixes, this time to accommodate database dialects
      that both don't yet report on unique constraints, but the backend
      does report unique constraints as indexes.   The logic
      Alembic uses to distinguish between "this is an index!" vs.
      "this is a unique constraint that is also reported as an index!" has now
      been further enhanced to not produce unwanted migrations when the dialect
      is observed to not yet implement get_unique_constraints() (e.g. mssql).
      Note that such a backend will no longer report index drops for unique
      indexes, as these cannot be distinguished from an unreported unique
      index.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 183

      Extensive changes have been made to more fully support SQLAlchemy's new
      naming conventions feature.  Note that while SQLAlchemy has added this
      feature as of 0.9.2, some additional fixes in 0.9.4 are needed to
      resolve some of the issues:

      1. The :class:`.Operations` object now takes into account the naming
         conventions that are present on the :class:`.MetaData` object that's
         associated using :paramref:`~.EnvironmentContext.configure.target_metadata`.
         When :class:`.Operations` renders a constraint directive like
         ``ADD CONSTRAINT``, it now will make use of this naming convention
         when it produces its own temporary :class:`.MetaData` object.

      2. Note however that the autogenerate feature in most cases generates
         constraints like foreign keys and unique constraints with the
         final names intact; the only exception are the constraints implicit
         with a schema-type like Boolean or Enum.  In most of these cases,
         the naming convention feature will not take effect for these constraints
         and will instead use the given name as is, with one exception....

      3. Naming conventions which use the ``"%(constraint_name)s"`` token, that
         is, produce a new name that uses the original name as a component,
         will still be pulled into the naming convention converter and be
         converted.  The problem arises when autogenerate renders a constraint
         with it's already-generated name present in the migration file's source
         code, the name will be doubled up at render time due to the combination
         of #1 and #2.  So to work around this, autogenerate now renders these
         already-tokenized names using the new :meth:`.Operations.f` component.
         This component is only generated if **SQLAlchemy 0.9.4** or greater
         is in use.

      Therefore it is highly recommended that an upgrade to Alembic 0.6.4
      be accompanied by an upgrade of SQLAlchemy 0.9.4, if the new naming
      conventions feature is used.

      Added new argument
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.user_module_prefix`.
      This prefix is applied when autogenerate renders a user-defined type,
      which here is defined as any type that is from a module outside of the
      ``sqlalchemy.`` hierarchy.   This prefix defaults to ``None``, in
      which case the :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.sqlalchemy_module_prefix`
      is used, thus preserving the current behavior.

      objects specified in the metadata have an explicit ``schema`` attribute
      whose name matches that of the connection's default schema
      (e.g. "public" for Postgresql).  Previously, it was assumed that "schema"
      was ``None`` when it matched the "default" schema, now the comparison
      adjusts for this.

      The :func:`.compare_metadata` public API function now takes into

     The :class:`.ScriptDirectory` system that loads migration files

     "sourceless" operation,  where the ``.py`` files are not present
     and instead ``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files are directly present where
     the ``.py`` files should be.  Note that while Python 3.3 has a
     new system of locating ``.pyc``/``.pyo`` files within a directory
     called ``__pycache__`` (e.g. PEP-3147), PEP-3147 maintains
     support for the "source-less imports" use case, where the
     ``.pyc``/``.pyo`` are in present in the "old" location, e.g. next
     to the ``.py`` file; this is the usage that's supported even when
     running Python3.3.

      An almost-rewrite of the new unique constraint/index autogenerate
      detection, to accommodate a variety of issues.  The emphasis is on
      not generating false positives for those cases where no net change
      is present, as these errors are the ones that impact all autogenerate
      runs:

        * Fixed an issue with unique constraint autogenerate detection where
          a named ``UniqueConstraint`` on both sides with column changes would
          render with the "add" operation before the "drop", requiring the
          user to reverse the order manually.

        * Corrected for MySQL's apparent addition of an implicit index
          for a foreign key column, so that it doesn't show up as "removed".
          This required that the index/constraint autogen system query the
          dialect-specific implementation for special exceptions.

        * reworked the "dedupe" logic to accommodate MySQL's bi-directional
          duplication of unique indexes as unique constraints, and unique
          constraints as unique indexes.  Postgresql's slightly different
          logic of duplicating unique constraints into unique indexes
          continues to be accommodated as well.  Note that a unique index
          or unique constraint removal on a backend that duplicates these may
          show up as a distinct "remove_constraint()" / "remove_index()" pair,
          which may need to be corrected in the post-autogenerate if multiple
          backends are being supported.

        * added another dialect-specific exception to the SQLite backend
          when dealing with unnamed unique constraints, as the backend can't
          currently report on constraints that were made with this technique,
          hence they'd come out as "added" on every run.

        * the ``op.create_table()`` directive will be auto-generated with
          the ``UniqueConstraint`` objects inline, but will not double them
          up with a separate ``create_unique_constraint()`` call, which may
          have been occurring.  Indexes still get rendered as distinct
          ``op.create_index()`` calls even when the corresponding table was
          created in the same script.

        * the inline ``UniqueConstraint`` within ``op.create_table()`` includes
          all the options like ``deferrable``, ``initially``, etc.  Previously
          these weren't rendering.

      :tags: feature, mssql

      Added new argument ``mssql_drop_foreign_key`` to
      :meth:`.Operations.drop_column`.  Like ``mssql_drop_default``
      and ``mssql_drop_check``, will do an inline lookup for a
      single foreign key which applies to this column, and drop it.
      For a column with more than one FK, you'd still need to explicitly
      use :meth:`.Operations.drop_constraint` given the name,
      even though only MSSQL has this limitation in the first place.

      in both Py2k and Py3k.   Also added source encoding detection using
      Mako's parse_encoding() routine in Py2k so that the __doc__ of a
      non-ascii revision file can be treated as unicode in Py2k.

      Added new kw argument to :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure`
      ``include_object``.  This is a more flexible version of the
      ``include_symbol`` argument which allows filtering of columns as well as tables
      from the autogenerate process,
      and in the future will also work for types, constraints and
      other constructs.  The fully constructed schema object is passed,
      including its name and type as well as a flag indicating if the object
      is from the local application metadata or is reflected.

      The "implicit" constraint generated by a

      While SQLite supports adding a CHECK constraint
      at the column level, SQLAlchemy would need modification

      API rearrangement allows everything
      Alembic does to be represented by contextual
      objects, including EnvironmentContext,
      MigrationContext, and Operations.   Other
      libraries and applications can now use
      things like "alembic.op" without relying
      upon global configuration variables.
      The rearrangement was done such that
      existing migrations should be OK,
      as long as they use the pattern
      of "from alembic import context" and
      "from alembic import op", as these
      are now contextual objects, not modules.

      The naming of revision files can
      now be customized to be some combination
      of "rev id" and "slug", the latter of which
      is based on the revision message.
      By default, the pattern "<rev>_<slug>"
      is used for new files.   New script files
      should include the "revision" variable
      for this to work, which is part of
      the newer script.py.mako scripts.

        :tickets:

      Alembic is used in at least one production
      environment, but should still be considered
      ALPHA LEVEL SOFTWARE as of this release,
      particularly in that many features are expected
      to be missing / unimplemented.   Major API
      changes are not anticipated but for the moment
      nothing should be assumed.

      The author asks that you *please* report all
      issues, missing features, workarounds etc.
      to the bugtracker.

      Python 3 is supported and has been tested.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      The "Pylons" and "MultiDB" environment templates
      have not been directly tested - these should be
      considered to be samples to be modified as
      needed.   Multiple database support itself
      is well tested, however.

        :tickets:

      Postgresql and MS SQL Server environments
      have been tested for several weeks in a production
      environment.  In particular, some involved workarounds
      were implemented to allow fully-automated dropping
      of default- or constraint-holding columns with
      SQL Server.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      MySQL support has also been implemented to a
      basic degree, including MySQL's awkward style
      of modifying columns being accommodated.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      Other database environments not included among
      those three have *not* been tested, *at all*.  This
      includes Firebird, Oracle, Sybase.   Adding
      support for these backends should be
      straightforward.  Please report all missing/
      incorrect behaviors to the bugtracker! Patches
      are welcome here but are optional - please just
      indicate the exact format expected by the target
      database.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      SQLite, as a backend, has almost no support for
      schema alterations to existing databases.  The author
      would strongly recommend that SQLite not be used in
      a migration context - just dump your SQLite database
      into an intermediary format, then dump it back
      into a new schema.  For dev environments, the
      dev installer should be building the whole DB from
      scratch.  Or just use Postgresql, which is a much
      better database for non-trivial schemas.
      Requests for full ALTER support on SQLite should be
      reported to SQLite's bug tracker at
      http://www.sqlite.org/src/wiki?name=Bug+Reports,
      as Alembic will not be implementing the
      "rename the table to a temptable then copy the
      data into a new table" workaround.
      Note that Alembic will at some point offer an
      extensible API so that you can implement commands
      like this yourself.

      Well-tested directives include add/drop table, add/drop
      column, including support for SQLAlchemy "schema"
      types which generate additional CHECK
      constraints, i.e. Boolean, Enum.  Other directives not
      included here have *not* been strongly tested
      in production, i.e. rename table, etc.

      Both "online" and "offline" migrations, the latter
      being generated SQL scripts to hand off to a DBA,

        :tickets:

      Many migrations are still outright missing, i.e.
      create/add sequences, etc.  As a workaround,
      execute() can be used for those which are missing,
      though posting of tickets for new features/missing
      behaviors is strongly encouraged.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      Autogenerate feature is implemented and has been
      tested, though only a little bit in a production setting.
      In particular, detection of type and server
      default changes are optional and are off by default;
      they can also be customized by a callable.
      Both features work but can have surprises particularly
      the disparity between BIT/TINYINT and boolean,
      which hasn't yet been worked around, as well as
      format changes performed by the database on defaults
      when it reports back.  When enabled, the PG dialect
      will execute the two defaults to be compared to
      see if they are equivalent.  Other backends may
      need to do the same thing.

      The autogenerate feature only generates
      "candidate" commands which must be hand-tailored
      in any case, so is still a useful feature and
      is safe to use.  Please report missing/broken features
      of autogenerate!  This will be a great feature and
      will also improve SQLAlchemy's reflection services.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      Support for non-ASCII table, column and constraint
      names is mostly nonexistent.   This is also a
      straightforward feature add as SQLAlchemy itself
      supports unicode identifiers; Alembic itself will
      likely need fixes to logging, column identification
      by key, etc. for full support here.
