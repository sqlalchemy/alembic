    Created a "test suite" similar to the one for SQLAlchemy, allowing
    developers of third-party dialects to test their code against a set of
    Alembic tests that have been specially selected to exercise
    back-end database operations. At the time of release,
    third-party dialects that have adopted the Alembic test suite to verify
    compatibility include
    `CockroachDB
        <https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-cockroachdb/>`_ and
    `SAP ASE (Sybase)
        <https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-sybase/>`_.
