    Resolved remaining Python 3 deprecation warnings, covering
    the use of inspect.formatargspec() with a vendored version
    copied from the Python standard library, importing
    collections.abc above Python 3.3 when testing against abstract
    base classes, fixed one occurrence of log.warn(), as well as a few
    invalid escape sequences.
