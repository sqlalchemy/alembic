    Implemented DDL for column comment add/update/delete when using the
    :paramref:`.Operations.alter_column.comment` parameter with
    :meth:`.Operations.alter_column` on Microsoft SQL Server.  Previously,
    these functions were not implemented for SQL Server and would raise
    ``UnsupportedCompilationError``.
