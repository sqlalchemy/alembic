   Fixed issue where usage of the PostgreSQL ``postgresql_include`` option
   within a :meth:`.Operations.create_index` would raise a KeyError, as the
   additional column(s) need to be added to the table object used by the
   construct internally. The issue is equivalent to the SQL Server issue fixed
   in :ticket:`513`. Pull request courtesy Steven Bronson.
