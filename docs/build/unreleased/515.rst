   :tags: bug, autogenerate
   :tickets: 515

   The ``system=True`` flag on :class:`.Column`, used primarily in conjunction
   with the Postgresql "xmin" column, now renders within the autogenerate
   render process, allowing the column to be excluded from DDL.  Additionally,
   adding a system=True column to a model will produce no autogenerate diff as
   this column is implicitly present in the database.
