    Fixed bug where the :meth:`.Script.as_revision_number` method
    did not accommodate for the 'heads' identifier, which in turn
    caused the :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_head_revisions`
    and :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_revision_argument` methods
    to be not usable when multiple heads were present.
    The :meth:.`EnvironmentContext.get_head_revisions` method returns
    a tuple in all cases as documented.
