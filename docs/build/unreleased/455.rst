    The fix for :ticket:`455` in version 0.9.6 involving MySQL server default
    comparison was entirely non functional, as the test itself was also broken
    and didn't reveal that it wasn't working. The regular expression to compare
    server default values like CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to current_timestamp() is
    repaired.
