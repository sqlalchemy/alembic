    Disallow ':' character in custom revision identifiers. Previously, using a
    colon in a revision ID (e.g., 'REV:1') would create the revision, however
    revisions with colons in them are not correctly interpreted by other
    commands, as it overlaps with the revision range syntax.   Pull request
