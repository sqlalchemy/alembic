    Fixed an issue where revision descriptions were essentially
    being formatted twice. Any revision description that contained
    characters like %, writing output to stdout will fail because
    the call to config.print_stdout attempted to format any
    additional args passed to the function.
    This fix now only applies string formatting if any args are provided
    along with the output text.
