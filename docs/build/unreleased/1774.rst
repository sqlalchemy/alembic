    The ``file_template`` configuration option now supports directory paths,
    allowing migration files to be organized into subdirectories. When using
    directory separators in ``file_template`` (e.g.,
    ``%(year)d/%(month).2d/%(day).2d_%(rev)s_%(slug)s``), Alembic will
    automatically create the necessary directory structure. The
    ``recursive_version_locations`` setting must be set to ``true`` when using
    this feature in order for the revision files to be located for subsequent
    commands.
