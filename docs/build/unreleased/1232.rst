    The ``primary_key`` parameter on :class:`.Column` is now honored when
    :meth:`.Operations.add_column` is used, and will emit the "PRIMARY KEY"
    keyword inline within the ADD COLUMN directive.  This is strictly a syntax
    enhancement; no attempt is made to reconcile the column's primary key
    status with any existing primary key constraint or particular backend
    limitations on adding columns to the primary key.
