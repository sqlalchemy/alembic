    Added ``inline_references`` parameter to :meth:`.Operations.add_column`
    which allows rendering of ``REFERENCES`` clauses inline within the ``ADD
    COLUMN`` directive rather than as a separate ``ADD CONSTRAINT`` directive.
    This syntax is supported by PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL 5.7+, and MariaDB
    10.5+, and can provide performance benefits on large tables by avoiding
    full table validation when adding a nullable foreign key column.
