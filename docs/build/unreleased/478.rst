    :tickets: 478

    Fixed bug where autogenerate of :class:`.ExcludeConstraint`
    would render a raw quoted name for a Column that has case-sensitive
    characters, which when invoked as an inline member of the Table
    would produce a stack trace that the quoted name is not found.
    An incoming Column object is now rendered as ``sa.column('name')``.
