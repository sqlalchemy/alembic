    :tags: bug, autogenerate
    :tickets: 1787

    Fixed regression in version 1.18.0 due to :ticket:`1771` where autogenerate
    would raise ``NoReferencedTableError`` when a foreign key constraint
    referenced a table that was not part of the initial table load, including
    tables filtered out by the
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_name` callable or tables
    in remote schemas that were not included in the initial reflection run.

    The change in :ticket:`1771` was a performance optimization that eliminated
    additional reflection queries for tables that were only referenced by
    foreign keys but not explicitly included in the main reflection run.
    However, this optimization inadvertently removed the creation of
    :class:`.Table` objects for these referenced tables, causing autogenerate
    to fail when processing foreign key constraints that pointed to them.

    The fix creates placeholder :class:`.Table` objects for foreign key targets
    that are not reflected, allowing the autogenerate comparison to proceed
    without error while maintaining the performance improvement from
    :ticket:`1771`. When multiple foreign keys reference different columns in
    the same filtered table, the placeholder table accumulates all necessary
    columns. These placeholder tables may be visible when using the
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_object` callable to
    inspect :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` objects; they will have the name,
    schema and basic column information for the relevant columns present.
