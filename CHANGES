0.1.0
=====
- Initial release.  Status of features:

- Alembic is used in at least one production 
  environment, but should still be considered 
  ALPHA LEVEL SOFTWARE as of this release,
  particularly in that many features are expected
  to be missing / unimplemented.
  The author asks that you *please* report all
  issues, missing features, workarounds etc.
  to the bugtracker, at 
  https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/issues/new .

- Python 3 is supported but has not yet
  been tested.  The installer will run the 2to3
  tool as needed, but there are probably some 
  small workarounds that will be needed to get
  Py3K fully running.

- The "Pylons" and "MultiDB" environment templates
  have not been directly tested - these should be 
  considered to be samples to be modified as
  needed.   Multiple database support itself 
  is well tested, however.

- Postgresql and MS SQL Server environments
  have been tested for several weeks in a production
  environment.  In particular, some involved workarounds
  were implemented to allow fully-automated dropping 
  of default- or constraint-holding columns with 
  SQL Server.

- Other database environments not included among
  those two have *not* been tested, *at all*.  This
  includes MySQL, Firebird, Oracle, Sybase.   Adding
  support for these backends is *very easy*, and
  many directives may work already if they conform
  to standard forms.   Please report all missing/
  incorrect behaviors to the bugtracker! Patches
  are welcome here but are optional - please just
  indicate the exact format expected by the target
  database.

- SQLite, as a backend, has almost no support for 
  schema alterations to existing databases.  The author
  would strongly recommend that SQLite not be used in 
  a migration context - just dump your SQLite database
  into an intermediary format, then dump it back
  into a new schema.  For dev environments, the 
  dev installer should be building the whole DB from 
  scratch.  Or just use Postgresql, which is a much
  better database for non-trivial schemas.  
  Requests for full ALTER support on SQLite should be 
  reported to SQLite's bug tracker at 
  http://www.sqlite.org/src/wiki?name=Bug+Reports,
  as Alembic will not be implementing the
  "rename the table to a temptable then copy the 
  data into a new table" workaround.
  Note that Alembic will at some point offer an 
  extensible API so that you can implement commands 
  like this yourself.

- Well-tested directives include add/drop table, add/drop
  column, including support for SQLAlchemy "schema" 
  types which generate additional CHECK 
  constraints, i.e. Boolean, Enum.  Other directives not
  included here have *not* been strongly tested
  in production, i.e. rename table, etc.

- Both "online" and "offline" migrations, the latter
  being generated SQL scripts to hand off to a DBA,
  have been strongly production tested against 
  Postgresql and SQL Server.

- Modify column type, default status, nullable, is
  functional and tested but not yet widely tested
  in production usage.

- Many migrations are still outright missing, i.e.
  create/add sequences, etc.  As a workaround, 
  execute() can be used for those which are missing,
  though posting of tickets for new features/missing
  behaviors is strongly encouraged.

- Autogenerate feature is implemented in a rudimentary
  fashion.  It's covered by unit and integration tests
  and has had some basic testing.  The feature
  has *not* been used in a production setting so is likely
  missing lot of desirable behaviors.  The
  autogenerate feature only generates "candidate" commands
  which must be hand-tailored in any case, so this only
  impacts the usefulness of the command, not overall
  stability.   Please report missing/broken features
  of autogenerate!  This will be a great feature and
  will also improve SQLAlchemy's reflection services.

- Support for non-ASCII table, column and constraint
  names is mostly nonexistent.   This is also a 
  straightforward feature add as SQLAlchemy itself 
  supports unicode identifiers; Alembic itself will 
  likely need fixes to logging, column identification 
  by key, etc. for full support here.

- Support for tables in remote schemas, 
  i.e. "schemaname.tablename", is very poor.   
  Missing "schema" behaviors should be 
  reported as tickets, though in the author's
  experience, migrations typically proceed only
  within the default schema.
